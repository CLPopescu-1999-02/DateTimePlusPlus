DateTimePlusPlus
================

This is a small C++ library designed to mimic the behavior of System.DateTime
and System.TimeSpan from C#. It is not meant to be a precise port. Rather, the
only standard is that the classes make use of the same 64-bit signed integer
'ticks' value (representing 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 0001).

All of this code is in the **public domain**. Use it for whatever you like. It
is strictly research for me in making good, clean time-related tools.
